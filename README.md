# Information

This app was created with React, using CRA to build the app. The purpose of this website is to make GenG BAW Rookies to be able to view additional resources and independent learning.

Technology used: React, react-router.

## Where to start?
Read from index.js to view the routes. App.js is the index for the website.

## How to use?
Every day have 4 sections: Materials, slides, quiz, homework. They are being controlled by these 3 consts: materialBank, quizBank, and slidesLink. Insert the JSON data in those variables. 
However, for homework section, you have to create your own jsx function. There are no variables to control the section.

### Comments
/components/ is for the implementation of sections. /tools/ is for the /tools route, and styles are for CSS. 
If you notice in the public, I also added some HTML files instead of making a React component because they are static and serve as additional references only.
