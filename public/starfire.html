                        <p>
                            No words. Just, no words. Truly. This feeling is an amazing feeling. I would like
                            to thank all my friends on earth that have made my birthday this year to be an
                            spectacular event. Everyone held a surprise birthday party. I didn't expect it,
                            I was so surprised! Oh, my, dear holy Gods in Tamaran. I am still overwhelmed, even
                            until now.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Once again, thank you to my sweet baby, Rae-Rae, Beastie Boo, and Cybear for everything!

                            Hey, Starfire. Hacked your web :P
                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            Dear, Starfire. Why did you make the admin username and password so easy?
                            Like, ugh, username: Starfire... password: StarfireLovesRobin... even an
                            intellegent monkey could hack in your website. You should change it to something
                            less obvious. In my world, Azarath, at least, you're always equipped with a
                            lock-spell. In fact, I have made a self-made spell where if anyone or me touches my
                            books, their hands will basically melt and change into 100 thousands of meat-eating
                            ants. That's why I have always told you guys to never touch any of my books.
                            Anyways, TMI. I'll catch you later. Bye!
                        </p>

                            Anyways. We went to talk about this and that. Outside. Just the usual buzz, y'know. As
                            usual, she drank her favourite, ugh, God knows whatever is on her hand. I never liked it.
                            Mostly because it looks rather dangerous and yucky. Liquor's color is all black, and it has
                            the skull logo on it. It's of course look nothing like what I've seen in Tamaran.
                            Left alone on earth. I wonder if those UFOs were the one who gave her the liquor.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Wait. Why would there be UFOs?
